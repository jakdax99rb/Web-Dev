      <br />
      <u>Background</u><br />
      <p>I am pursuing a degree in computer science.</p>
      <br />
      <u>Programming Knowledge</u><br />
      <p>
        I have taken database classes, basic coding classes, and all the
        required ones for a GSU degree as this is my last class. For languages I
        know Java, Brainfuck, C, C++, Python, and SQL.
      </p>
      <br />
      <u>Software Development</u><br />
      <p>
        I have done a discord bot with a web interface to manage time
        coordination for people, I have made a web scraper that scrapes
        information for a games wiki and collates it into a single json file.
        Iâ€™ve also completely a software internship for a Home Healthcare
        technology provider where I worked with python and excel to do data
        processing. I have also done projects with machine learning in a data
        science class.
      </p>
      <br />
      <u>Interest</u><br />
      <p>
        I do not really have a specific interest I just love to code and really
        enjoy solving problems so any excuse I get to that that is a good thing
        for me.
      </p>
      <br />
      <u>Project Idea</u><br />
      <p>
        I want to create a message board system where users can create and
        comment on posts like reddit.
